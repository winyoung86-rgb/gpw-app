## How the AI Itinerary Works

1. **User selects an event** — one of the 6 circuit weekends listed above
2. **User picks tags** — 3 or more preferences from the categories above
3. **User sets dates** — arrival and departure dates within the event window
4. **AI generates itinerary** — the system queries the party database, scores each party against the user's tag preferences, and uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate a curated day-by-day itinerary with 1-3 recommended parties per day
5. **User reviews and customizes** — the generated itinerary is displayed with party details, and users can browse all available parties to add or swap recommendations

## Party Data

The database contains 150+ parties across all 6 events. Each party record includes:
- Party name and event weekend
- Date and time
- Venue name and location
- Ticket price tiers (general admission, VIP, etc.)
- Tags for vibe, crowd, music, dress code, and intensity
- Description and additional notes
